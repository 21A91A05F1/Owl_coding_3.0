/*
To set any bit we use bitwise OR | operator. As we already know bitwise OR | operator 
evaluates each bit of the result to 1 if any of the operandâ€™s corresponding bit is set (1). 
In-order to set kth bit of a number we need to shift 1 k times to its left 
and then perform bitwise OR operation with the number and result of left shift performed just before.
